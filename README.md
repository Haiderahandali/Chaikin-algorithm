### C++ implementation of Chaikin's Algorithm

#### The algorithm divides the straight lines into smaller one to form a curve (accuracy raises with number of iteration)


### the algorithm currently is slow as I used LinkedList and basic techniques to implement it quickly.

## Dependencies 
SDL, was used to draw the points, the CMakeLists.txt Assumes it was installed in the standard unix path (/usr/local/lib) as well as the headers are inside (/usr/local/include)
you may edit the CMakeLists.txt otherwise
